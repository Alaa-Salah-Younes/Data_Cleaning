# Data_Cleaning


##### Machine learning is all about training and feeding data to algorithms to perform various compute intensive tasks. However, businesses typically face challenges in feeding the right data to machine learning algorithms or cleaning of irrelevant and error-prone data. In other words, when it comes to utilizing ML data, most of the time is spent on cleaning data sets or creating a dataset that is free of errors. Setting up a quality plan, filling missing values, removing rows, reducing data size are some of the best practices used for data cleaning in Machine Learning.
